# Database-Course-Backup

This is the backup repo for my database course project finished at University of Saskatchewan. 

You can find the schema we created for multiple museums with the same database structure to use.

Introduction:

Museum Alliance is a course database project we went through three phases to complete:
•	First, I used PostgreSQL to create a relational database for one museum to store the information of art collections, exhibitions and art work transactions. 
•	Then, I joined a team of five to combine our databases together. 
•	Last, we demonstrated the functionalists of the database through a one hour presentation to our professor.
