# Database-Course-Backup

This is the backup repo for my database course project finished at University of Saskatchewan. In here you can find the databse schema we created for the museums. 

Introduction:

Museum Alliance is a course database project we went through three phases to complete:

•	First, I used PostgreSQL to create a relational database for one museum to store the information of art collections, exhibitions and art work transactions. 

•	Then, I joined a team of five to combine our databases together. 

•	Last, we demonstrated the functionalists of the database through a one hour presentation to our professor.
